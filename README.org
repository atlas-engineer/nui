#+TITLE:NUI

NUI is a set of Spinneret tags useful in documentation, blog posts, and other text-centric HTML interfaces. It originates from Nyxt, where it's used in the manual and help system.

The tags that NUI provides are:
- Text/structure tags:
  - :nsection :: section, its heading with a link to itself, and a linkable ID.
  - :ntoc :: auto-generated Table of Contents for the provided HTML.
- Lisp-specific tags:
  - :ncode :: Lisp (or non-Lisp) code listing, enriched with symbol references and customizable actions.
  - :nxref :: reference to a symbol in a configurable documentation source.
- Interactive tags:
  - :nbutton :: a button invoking the action you provide.
  - :nselect :: ~<select>~ tag with Lisp actions bound to it.
  - :ninput :: input area tracking every modification and focus.
    
* Getting started
Clone the Git repository:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nui ~/common-lisp/
#+end_src

And then load ~:nui~ in the REPL:
#+begin_src lisp
  (asdf:load-system :nui)
  ;; or, if you use Quicklisp
  (ql:quickload :nui)
#+end_src

* Tag helpers

NUI exposes a set of methods that define how to process tag arguments and bodies. One has to specialize these methods before using NUI.

* History

NFiles was originally developed for user file management in [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer][Nyxt]], so the "N"
may stand for it, or "New", or whatever poetic meaning you may find behind it!
